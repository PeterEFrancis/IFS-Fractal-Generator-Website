                    First of all, it’s fun.<br>
                    Quadegories exercises the brain’s <i>executive function</i>
                    making it a valuable learning tool for teenagers and adults.

                    Executive function allows us to:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Make plans</li>
                      <li>Stay on task</li>
                      <li>Keep track of more than one thing at once</li>
                      <li>Reference past knowledge</li>
                      <li>Evaluate ideas</li>
                      <li>Change our minds</li>
                      <li>Finish work on time</li>
                    </ul>

                    Find yourself forgetful? Absent minded? Unable to make the
                    kinds of connections you’d easily make before?

                  OBJECTIVE: To gain as many points as possible or achieve a
                  predetermined winning score.<br/><br/>

                  GAME DIRECTIONS: Either designate one player as the
                  reader/facilitator or have players rotate serving as
                  reader/facilitator each round.<br/><br/>

                  Each round, the reader gets a new set of four clues, and reads
                  each, one at a time, (it is recommended to show counting on
                  your hand at five second intervals), until one player
                  either guesses correctly (winning a point) or is eliminated
                  from that round by providing an incorrect answer.<br/><br/>

                  To any guess there are only three possible responses the
                  reader/facilitator can give: CORRECT, INCORRECT or BE MORE
                  SPECIFIC. In the latter event, the player will be provided a
                  (one time only) additional five seconds to improve the
                  accuracy of the answer and either win the Quadegory or be
                  eliminated from that round.

                  How Quadegories Works</a>

                  Quadegories can be played alone, with others, or in teams.
                  <br/>
                  The goal is to guess the `common denominator' in a list of
                  four items.<br/>

                  For example, for clues,
                  <ol reversed>
                    <li> Nautilus
                    <li> Cockle
                    <li> Cawrie
                    <li> Conch
                  </ol>

                  the Quadegory is <strong>Shells</strong>.<br/><br/>

                  At any time during each round, players still in the game may
                  make ONE attempt at the correct answer. A player receives the
                  number of points corresponding to the clue that is given
                  directly before the correct guess. An incorrect answer
                  results in zero points and elimination from the round.
                  <br/><br/>

                  After each Quadegory, the reader may read the interesting
                  fact that is below the Quadegory about a topic related to
                  that round.
